# FriendlyClearMap-scripts

This is the collection of scripts to build your own Dockerfiles for ClearMap1 and ClearMap2's CellMap component, as outlined in: 
<X_publication to come> 

ClearMap 1 is as originally described in: 
Renier et al. Cell 2016. Mapping of Brain Activity by Automated Volume Analysis of Immediate Early Genes. Cell, 165(7), 1789–1802. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.007

 Code from: https://github.com/ChristophKirst/ClearMap and adapted as follows:
  - ported to Python 3, adapted to include ImageJ's BigWarp landmark output (see here for an earlier stage of this work: https://github.com/BrammBosch/clearmap) 
  - Adapted for Dockerization 
  
  
ClearMap 2 as originally described in:
Kirst et al., Cell 2020. Mapping the Fine-Scale Organization and Plasticity of the Brain Vasculature. Cell, 180(4), 780–795.e25. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.028
  
Code from: https://github.com/ChristophKirst/ClearMap2 and adapted the  CellMap portion (the TubeMap portion is not included) as follows: 
  - Adapted the Elastix registration to include ImageJ's BigWarp landmark output
  - Adapted for Dockerization
  - Included an adapted version of ClearMap1's Ilastik Cell Detection mode 
  
Please see the Appendices 1-3 of our <X_upcoming> publication for detailed instructions on how to use the pipelines.
